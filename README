Engione is a web framework based on micro core principle.

Why Engione? A lot of brilliant frameworks in web based on best practice and use famous patterns. 
But many of these ones contain ton code that do not use in real cases. Extends are unclear. 
Inner processes are closed. Some lines of real code are wrapped with boring infrastructure. 
Engione is not silver bullet, of course, but just implements some ideas for fun and fast web coding.
